Consider a rod of known length $l$ and mass $m$ resting on three supports, as shown below.

            \begin{enumerate}
            \item Draw a free-body diagram for the rod. Suppose we know that $N_{3}=4$. Use the external force balance and moment balance about $A$ to find the reaction forces $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$. 
             \item Consider the case where all reaction forces at the supports are unknown. Find the external force balance and the moment balance about points $A$ and $B$. Write the system in the form ${\bf A x}={\bf b}$, where ${\bf x}=(N_{1},N_{2},N_{3})^{T}$, ${\bf A}$ is a $3\times 3$ matrix of known values and ${\bf b}$ is a $3 \times 1$ vector of known values.
             \item Construct the augmented matrix ${\bf A|b}$ and use this to solve for ${\bf x}$ and find the set of all possible values for the reaction forces $N_{1}$, $N_{2}$ and $N_{3}$. Is the system statically indeterminate?
             \item From the resting constraint $N_{i}>0$. Use this to find the minimum and maximum values of each of reaction forces.

Two masses, $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are connected by a spring with stiffness $k$ attached to a light inextensible string running smoothly over a pulley, as shown below.

	    Mass $m_{2}$ rests on a slope at unknown angle $\theta$. 
            \begin{enumerate}
            \item Draw free body diagrams for both masses. Find the two horizontal and vertical force balance equations for each mass. 
	    \item Suppose $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are known. If there is no friction acting on the slope, for which values of $\sin\theta$ is there a unique solution?
	    \item Now suppose there is friction, and that $m_{2}$, $\mu$ and $\theta$ are all known. What is the set of values of $m_{1}$ for which static equilibrium is possible? What is the corresponding extension of the spring, $x$? Can $m_{1}=0$ and what is the condition in $\mu$ and $\theta$ for this to occur?

A uniform rod of mass $m$ and length $L$ is connected by a pin support to the wall at one end and suspended from the wall by a light inextensible string that is attached to the other end of the rod at a known angle $\theta$, as shown below

A uniform rod of mass $m$ and length $L$ learns against a wall. A mass $m_{1}$ is attached a distance $x$ from point $A$.

	    \item Now assume that friction acts at both $A$ and $B$. Find the set of solutions for the contact forces. Is the system statically determinate? Assume it now is about to slip at $B$. What are the contact forces?
