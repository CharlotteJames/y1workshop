  Consider a rod of known length $l$ and mass $m$ resting on
  three supports, as shown.\\
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{fig_1.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Draw a free-body diagram for the rod. Suppose we know that
        $N_{3}=4\newtons$. Use the external force balance and moment balance
        about $A$ to find the reaction forces $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$.
        \A{
          Our free body diagram will look the same as the diagram to the right
          but perhaps without the supports and with $N_3=4\newtons$ and $W=mg$
          acting at the centre. Horizontal force balance is useless but
          vertical force balance and moments gives
          \begin{align*}
              N_1 + N_2 + 4\newtons &= mg \\
              \frac{l}{4}N_1 + \frac{l}{3}N_2 + \frac{3l}{4}4\newtons
                  &= \frac{l}{2}mg
          \end{align*}
          which has the unique solution
          \[
              N_1 = 20\newtons - 2mg, \quad\quad N_2 = 3mg - 24\newtons.
          \]
        }
      \item Consider the case where all reaction forces at the supports are
        unknown. Find the external force balance and the moment balance about
        points $A$ and $B$. Write the system in the form ${\bf A x}={\bf b}$,
        where ${\bf x}=(N_{1},N_{2},N_{3})^{T}$, ${\bf A}$ is a $3\times 3$
        matrix of known values and ${\bf b}$ is a $3 \times 1$ vector of known
        values.
        \A{
          The equations are
          \begin{align*}
            N_1 + N_2 + N_3 &= mg\\
            \frac{l}{4}N_1 + \frac{l}{3}N_2 + \frac{3l}{4}N_3 &= \frac{l}{2}mg
          \end{align*}
          and dividing by $l$ we can put this into matrix form as
          \begin{equation*}
            \begin{pmatrix}
              1 & 1 & 1 \\
              \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{3}{4}
            \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix}
              N_1 \\ N_2 \\ N_3
            \end{pmatrix}
              =
            \begin{pmatrix}
              mg \\ \frac{1}{2}mg
            \end{pmatrix}
          \end{equation*}
        }
      \item Construct the augmented matrix $(\mathbf{A}|\mathbf{b})$ and use
        this to solve for ${\bf x}$ and find the set of all possible values for
        the reaction forces $N_{1}$, $N_{2}$ and $N_{3}$. Is the system
        statically indeterminate?
        \A{
          Our augmented matrix is
          \begin{equation*}
            \left(
              \begin{array}{ccc|c}
                1 & 1 & 1 & mg \\
                \frac{1}{4} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{3}{4} & \frac{1}{2}mg
              \end{array}
            \right)
          \end{equation*}
          This has the family of solutions (for $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$)
          \[
            N_1 = 5\beta - 2mg,\quad N_2 = 3mg - 6\beta,\quad N_3 = \beta.
          \]
          The system is statically indeterminate since we didn't get a unique
          solution for the reaction forces.
        }
      \item From the resting constraint $N_{i}>0$. Use this to find the minimum
        and maximum values of each of the reaction forces.
        \A{
          This gives us one inequality for $\beta$ for each of the reaction
          forces. For example we have that $N_1 > 0$ which means that $5
          \beta - 2mg > 0$ or $beta > \frac{2}{5}mg$. Combining all three
          inqualities we find that
          \[
            \frac{2}{5}mg < \beta < \frac{1}{2}mg
          \]
          so although we don't have a unique solution we have some knowledge
          of $\beta$. With this we get the minimum and maximum values for the
          reaction forces to find that
          \[
            0 < N_1 < \frac{1}{2}mg,\quad
            0 < N_2 < \frac{3}{5}mg,\quad
            \frac{2}{5}mg < N_3 < \frac{1}{2}mg.
          \]
        }
    \end{enumerate}

\multiproblem{2}{
  A body is acted upon by three forces at the points $A$, $B$, and $C$ which
  have position vectors $(1, 2)\metres$, $(5, 1)\metres$ and $(4, 3)\metres$
  respectively. The force acting at $A$ is $\mathbf{F}_A = (2, 7)\newtons$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a good diagram of this body and the forces acting on it. The
      shape of the body is irrelevant for your answers to this question but
      feel free to draw it as the triangle $ABC$.
      \A{
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics{abc.pdf}
        \end{center}
      }
    \item Suppose that the force $\mathbf{F}_B=\mathbf{0}$. What would
      $\mathbf{F}_C=(F_{C1},F_{C2})$ need to be for force and moment balance
      to hold?
      \A{
        This is a trick question: no equilibrium is possible if
        $\mathbf{F}_B=\mathbf{0}$. Force balance easily gives us that
        $\mathbf{F}_C = -\mathbf{F}_A = (-2,-7)\newtons$. However moment
        balance around $C$ gives that
        \[
          \mathbf{r}_{CA} \times \mathbf{F}_A = (-3,-1,0)\metres \times
          (2,7,0)\newtons = (0, 0, -18)\,\mathrm{Nm} = \mathbf{0}
        \]
        which is clearly untrue. The lesson here is that it is not enough to
        simply find the unknown forces in a statics problem -- we need to
        check all three equations for force and moment balance to determine
        whether an equilibrium is possible at all. A diagram makes it obvious
        that moment balance is impossible:
        \begin{center}
          \includegraphics{abc_mom.pdf}
        \end{center}
      }
    \item Suppose instead that the force $\mathbf{F}_B=(F_B,0)$ for what
      values of $F_B$, $F_{C1}$ and $F_{C2}$ would there be equilibrium?
      \A{
        Now we allow $\mathbf{F}_B$ to have a non-zero horizontal component
        equilbrium is possible. We do horizontal/vertical force balance and
        moment balance around $C$ to find
        \begin{align*}
          2\newtons + F_B + F_{C1} &= 0 \\
          7\newtons + F_{C2} &= 0 \\
          -18\,\mathrm{Nm} + (2\metres) F_B &= 0
        \end{align*}
        which gives a unique solution for the forces
        \[
          \mathbf{F}_B = (9, 0)\newtons,\quad
          \mathbf{F}_C = (-11,-7)\newtons.
        \]
      }
    \item Now suppose that we know nothing about either of $\mathbf{F}_B$ and
      $\mathbf{F}_C$. Find the set of all possible combinations of
      $\mathbf{F}_B$ and $\mathbf{F}_C$ for which equilibrium is possible.
      \A{
        Here we have 3 equations for 4 unknowns so we can will find an
        infinite family of possible solutions.
      }
    \item Use your understanding of linear systems with different numbers of
      equations and unknowns to explain why we get the three different
      situations seen in the previous parts.
      \A{
        In each of the previous parts force and moment balance gives us 3
        equations. In the first part we had 2 unknowns making the system
        over-determined so that we are likely to have no solutions (as is the
        case). In the second part we have 3 unknowns and we get a unique
        solution. In the third part we have too few equations for the number
        of unknowns making the system statically indeterminate.
      }
  \end{enumerate}

\multiproblem{3}{
  A uniform rod of mass $m$ and length $L$ is connected by a pin support to
  the wall at one end and suspended from the wall by a light inextensible
  string that is attached to the other end of the rod at a known angle
  $\theta$, as shown.\\
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[scale=1.8]{fig_3.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Draw a free-body diagram for the rod. Assuming the system is in
        static equilibrium, find the tension in the string.
        \A{
          Here is our free-body diagram
          \begin{center}
            \includegraphics{pinwall.pdf}
          \end{center}
          Moment balance around the pin support at the left gives that
          $LT\sin{\theta} = \frac{L}{2}mg$ so $T = \frac{mg}{2\sin{\theta}}$.
        }
      \item Now find the contact force at the pin support. What angle does it
        make to the horizontal?
        \A{
          We can now do force balance. Suppose that $\mathbf{F} = (F_x,F_y)$
          and we have that $\mathbf{T} = (-T\cos{\theta},T\sin{\theta})$
          balance gives
          \begin{align*}
            F_x - T\cos{\theta} &= 0 \\
            F_y + T\sin{\theta} &= mg.
          \end{align*}
          The second equation gives $F_y = \frac{1}{2}mg$ so that the vertical
          components of $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{T}$ are equal.  The first
          equation gives that the horizontal components of $\mathbf{T}$ and
          $\mathbf{F}$ are equal and opposite. This means that the angle made
          by $\mathbf{F}$ is also $\theta$
        }
      \item Show that the lines of action of all three forces intersect at a
        single point. Argue that this should always happen for a body acted
        upon by three forces.
        \A{
          Geometrically it is easy to see that all three forces intersect at a
          single point above the centre of the rod. To argue this in general
          consider the lines of action of the three forces. If two of these
          lines intersect at a point then take moments about that point.
          Moments about this point can only come from the third force so it
          must have no moment about this point. If the third has no moments
          about this point then its line of action must also go through the
          same point. The only exception (in 2D) is if all three lines are
          parallel (as in question 1).
