	\begin{enumerate}
	\item{ Firstly, justify that the units of the spring constant are N/m with the use of Hooke's Law. \A {\\Force (N) = constant $\times$ extension (m), and so constant= Force (N) / extension (m)}

The block is also attached by a spring (with spring constant $k$ and natural length $l$) to the wall. The distance of the block from this wall is given by $d$. Given that $m=1$ kg and $l=1$ m:
	\begin{enumerate}

	}
	\item{Assuming that the surface is smooth ($\mu=0$) and the spring constant $k>0$, state the distance $d$ at which the system is in equilibrium. \A{\\The horizontal forces must balance so the spring force $F_s=k(d-l)$ is equivalent to the frictional force $F_f\leq\mu F_N$, since $\mu=0$ this frictional force must also equal 0 and so $F_s=k(d-l)=0$ which implies $x=l$m}

	\item Find two inequalities for the range of values of $\mu$, the coefficient of friction, that ensure the system is in equilibrium. 
	\A {\\From the free body diagrams we have: $N_1 = m_1g$, $N_2 = m_2g$, $F_2 = k_2x_2$ , $F_1 = k_1(x_1-x_2)$.}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Draw free body force diagrams for both the block and the particle}
	\item{Point $B$ is at position $-1$i$+1$j from point $A$. If $m=1$ kg and $\mu=1$ can the system be in equilibrium?\A {\\Yes: If in equilibrium the forces are balanced on the particle and so the tension in the pulley string is equivalent to the weight of the particle ($T_p=mg$). Now looking at the block we can see that the frictional force must act on the block in the direction down the slope. So assuming equilibrium, resolving the forces parallel to the slope we have $T_p=mg=mg$sin$(\theta) + F_f$ where $theta$ is the angle of the slope. This angle of the slope with the horizontal can be found to be $theta=45^o=\pi/4$rad from the position vector. Furthermore, the frictional force is given by the inequality $F_f\leq \mu F_N$ where $F_N$ is the normal force (perpendicular to the slope). This can be found to give $F_f\leq \mu  mg$cos$(\theta)$. If we substitute this into the earlier equation we find $mg(1-$sin$(\theta))=F_f\leq\mu  mg$cos$(\theta)$ which simplifies to $1-$sin$(\theta)\leq$cos$(\theta)$ which is easily shown to be true.}

	\item{What is the critical value of $\mu$ (the smallest value such that the system may still be in equilibrium)? 
	\A {\\At this critical point $F_f=\mu F_n$ and so it can be found in the same way as before that $\mu mg$cos$(\theta)+mg$sin$(\theta)=mg$ which can be easily rearranged to give 		$\mu=(1-$sin$(\theta))/$cos$(\theta))=\sqrt{2}-1\approx 0.41$}

\item{Now give an expression for critical value of $\mu$ for the system when the slope makes an angle $\alpha$ to the horizontal.
