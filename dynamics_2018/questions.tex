\newline
%For the following examples, calculate the work done on a particle of mass $m$ by each force.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A mass $m$ is released from a height $h$ above the ground. Calculate the work done by the gravitational force on the mass.
%
\item A mass $m$ is resting on a smooth surface and attached to a spring, the other end of which is attached to a wall. If the spring has natural length $L$ and spring constant $k$, calculate the work done on the mass when it is moved from position $P_1 = L$ to position $P_2 = 2L$.
%
\item A mass $m$ is constrained to move in an arc of radius $R$ on the surface of a table (ie. in a horizontal plane). Assume the table has a friction coefficient $\mu$. Calculate the work done by the friction force acting on the mass as it moves at constant velocity from $P_1 = (R,0)$ to $P_2 = (R,\pi)$, where positions are expressed in polar co-ordinates.

%
%ANSWER
\A{Using work-energy theorem, $W = \Delta T$}
\A{$\Delta T = \frac{1}{2}m(|{\bf v}(t)|^2 - |{\bf v}(0)|^2)$}
\A{$\Delta T = \frac{1}{2}m (v_0^2 + 2v_0gt \sin\alpha + (gt)^2 - v_0^2) =  \frac{1}{2}m (2v_0gt \sin\alpha + (gt)^2)$}

\multiproblem{4}{{\it Mass on a rough slope}\newline

Now assume that mass $m$ is on a rough slope, with coefficient of friction $\mu$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the mass is stationary (not slipping), which forces acting on the mass are forces of constraint?
%
\item Using force balance, write an equation for the net force parallel to the slope acting on the mass when it is stationary.
%
\item Now assume the mass is slipping. How much work is done on the mass moving it from ${\bf r}_0$ to ${\bf r}_1$? If it then moves back to ${\bf r}_0$, what is the total amount of work that has been done?
%
\item Using your expression for the net force, determine expressions for the velocity and position of the mass as functions of time, $v(t)$ and $r(t)$.
\item If the mass is given an initial velocity $v_0$ acting down the slope, calculate the work done on the mass by the friction force to bring it to rest.

\multiproblem{5}{{\it Mass on a (hypothetical) rollercoaster}\newline
Consider a mass $m$ moving at velocity $v_0$ towards a rollercoaster loop of radius $R$. When it is at the top of the loop, its velocity will be $v_1$. Assume the rollercoaster track has no friction.

	\begin{center}
                \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{coaster.pdf}
         \end{center}
         
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a free body diagram of the mass when it is at the top of the loop. 
\item From your free body diagram, write down an inequality for the normal reaction, $N$, being exerted on the mass by the rollercoaster track.
%
\A{At the top of the loop, $N \geq 0$. From force balance we have $N + mg = \frac{mv_1^2}{R}.$}
\A{Hence, $\frac{mv_1^2}{R} - mg \geq 0$. Rearranging gives $v_1^2 \geq gR$.
}
%
\item Using this inequality along with what you know about conservative forces, determine the minimum value of $v_0$, as a function of $g$ and $R$, which ensures the mass will not leave the track as it passes through the loop. 
%
\A{Only conservative forces acting so energy is conserved.}
\A{$E = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_1^2 + 2mgR$}
\A{Rearrange for $v_1^2$ and substitute into the inequality from the previous part: $v_0^2 - 4gR \geq gR$.}
\A{Minimum value of $v_0$ is thus $v_0 = \sqrt{5gR}$.}
