		\item{ What are the limit of this position as $u\to \infty$ and $u\to 0$ \A{ \\
			This can either be found by intuition, or by mathematically finding the limits.\\
			\textit{Intuitively}, as $u\to \infty$ the time taken to reach the slope tends to zero, and so the distance the projectile falls tends to zero (at a faster rate $s_y=\mathcal{O}(t^2)$ ). Therefore we can deduce that the position vector $\underline{p}\to (h,0)^T$.\\
			As $u\to 0$ the projectile can be considered as simply falling vertically, and so the distance the projectile travels horizontally tends to zero. We know that $s_y=s_x-h$, therefore we can deduce that the position vector $\underline{p}\to (0,-h)^T$.\\
			\textit{Mathematically}, the limit as $u\to 0$ can also be found in a few ways. We can find that the limit as $T\to0$ is finite $\sqrt{2h/g}$ and so $s_x=uT\to0$. We can then trivially find $\underline(p)\to(-h,0)^T$.
			The limit as $u\to \infty$ is far harder. Let us start by rearranging $$s_x=\frac{-u^2+u\sqrt{u^2 +2gh}}{g}=\frac{u^2}{g}\left(-1+\sqrt{1+\frac{2gh}{u^2}}\right)$$
			Now we need the expansion $$(1+z)^a=1+az+\frac{a(a-1)}{2!}z^2+...$$

			We can find this by looking at the larger solution to $t$, $T=\frac{u+\sqrt{u^2-400}}{10}$.

	This question deals with deriving the SUVAT equations. In general the differential equations relating displacement, velocity and acceleration of a body are given by $\frac{ds(t)}{dt}=v(t)$, and $\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=a(t)$.

		Constant acceleration implies $a(t)=a$, so by integrating both sides of $\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=a$ w.r.t. $t$ we find $v(t) = v(0) + at$.\\

		Starting with $\frac{ds(t)}{dt}=v(t)$, mulitply both sides by $dt$ and integrate, $\int ds = \int v(t) dt$. \\
		Since the LHS is just $s(t)$, this tells us that displacement is equal to the area under the graph of $v(t)$. \\

		From a simple veolcity time graph with constant acceleration, we can see that the area under $v(t)$ will always be a trapezium (or a trinagle if $u=0$). \\
		Hence we can find this area by taking the average of the two endpoints, which are at $u$ and $v$ over $t$. Or we can just find it geomtrically. This gives us $s=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)t$.}}

		\item{From Newton's First Law, constant acceleration implies constant force acting on the body. Write down expressions for work done and kinetic energy, and hence derive S(4). (You will need to use the fact that work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy) \A{ \\
		The scalar expression for work done is $W=Fs$, and for the kinetic energy of a body with mass $m$ is $E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$. \\
		Using the fact that work done can be measured as the change in kinetic energy of a body $W=\Delta E_k$, we can see the work done taking the body from initial velocity $u$ to final velocity $v$ is $W=\frac{1}{2}m\Delta v^2=\frac{1}{2}m(v^2-u^2)$ in SUVAT notation. \\

		We begin by finding expressions for the car's velocity and displacement at time $\tau$, just before the deceleration is applied. We use a subscript 1 to denote quantities before deceleration, and subscript 2 for after. \\
		Using the same equation as above we find $s_1=\frac{1}{2}(4\tau^2)=2\tau^2$. From $v_1=u_1+a_1t$ with $u_1=0$ we have $v_1=2\tau$. \\
		Now, we need to find the force applied to get the car to stop. This means we need the acceleration applied after $\tau$, $a_2$. Our initial velocity is the final velocity from before $u_2=v_1=2\tau$. \\
		Since we need to come to a stop at the flag 20m away, and we've already travelled a distance of $s_1$, we have $s_2=20-s_1=20-2\tau^2$. Also, since we come to a stop, $v_2=0$.

		The force required is directly proportial to this so we find, $$F(\tau)=\frac{-4m\tau^2}{10-\tau^2}.$$\\

		Using trigonometry we can split the initial veolicty into vertical and horizontal components: $(u_x, u_y) = (u\cos(\theta), u\sin(\theta))$.}

		\item{If $\big(s_x(t), s_y(t)\big)$ is a firework's position at time $t$, show that the graph of a firework's trajectory is
		\begin{equation}
			s_y = s_x \tan\theta - \frac{s_x^2g}{2v^2}\big(1+\tan^2\theta\big).
		\end{equation}
		\textit{Hint: Begin by finding $s_x$ and $s_y$ and then relate them by explicitly eliminating $t$.} \A{ \\
		We use the vector form of $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$, with $(u_x,u_y)$ as above and $(a_x,a_y)=(0,g)$. We find $$s_x = ut\cos(\theta)$$ $$s_y=ut\sin(\theta)+\frac{1}{2}gt^2.$$ \\
		Rearranging the first equation we have $t=\frac{s_x}{u\cos(\theta)}$, substituting this into our equation for $s_y$ we can eliminate any explicit dependence on $t$, to give, $$s_y = s_x \tan(\theta) + \frac{g}{2}\Big(\frac{s_x^2}{u^2\cos^2(\theta)}\Big).$$ \\
		Then using the fact that $\frac{1}{\cos^2(\theta)}=\text{sech}^2(\theta)=1+\tan^2(\theta)$, $$s_y = x\tan(\theta)+\frac{gs_x^2}{2gu^2}\Big(1+\tan^2(\theta)\Big),$$ as required. \\
		It's important at this point to understand what this solution is. If we choose one particular value, $\theta=\theta'$, the graph of $s_y(s_x, \theta')$ is the trajectory of the firework fired at angle $\theta'$, which will be a parabola. Of course then if we choose a particular $s_x$ then we would find a position along this trajectory $(s_x,s_y)$.
		}}
		%
		\item{This equation is the family of all possible firework trajectories. You can think of it as $s_y$ as a function of $s_x$, parametrised by a choice of $\theta\in[0,\pi]$. In other words for a particular choice of $\theta$, the graph of $s_y(s_x)$ is that firework's trajectory. Now, we want to maximise this set over $\theta$. Find $\frac{\partial s_y}{\partial \theta}$ and hence find the maximal $s_y$ position for any given $s_x$ position.
		\textit{Hint: Instead, use the substitution $z=\tan\theta$ and maximise $s_y(s_x)$ with respect to $z$. Bonus question: think why this substitution is allowed by considering the graph of $\tan(\theta)$.} \A{ \\
		From here, it is useful to consider $s_y$ as a multivariate function in $s_x$ and $\theta$, $s_y(s_x,\theta)$. \\
		To maximise a function over its range we find where the derivative vanishes, then we can check to see if the function is locally maximal there by looking at the second derivative (curvature). \\
		For multivariate functions, such as this, we find where the relevant partial derivative vanishes. Using the substitution $z=\tan(\theta)$, we have $$s_y = s_x z + \frac{gs_x^2}{2u^2}(1+z^2)$$
		$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial z} = x + \frac{gzs_x^2}{u^2}.$$ Solving where this is zero is the turning point, we find it occurs where $z=z_{max}=-\frac{u^2}{gs_x}$, notice this is a function of $s_x$ but not $s_y$. We can check this is maximal by seeing the second partial derivative here is negative. \\
		By substituting this value for $z_{max}$ into equation our equation for $s_y$, we only consider a special `slice' through the function $s_y$ such that it is only dependent on $s_x$ and along which $s_y$ is maximal for any given $s_x$.\\
		So we denote $s_{max,y}(s_x):=s_y(s_x, z_{max})$ and find, $$s_{max,y} = -\frac{u^2}{g}+\frac{gs_x^2}{u^2}\Big(1+\Big(\frac{u^2}{gs_x}\Big)^2\Big) = \frac{1}{2}\Big(\frac{gs_x^2}{u^2}-\frac{u^2}{g}\Big).$$ \\
		The graph of $s_{max,y}(s_x)$ is our solution. If we choose a distance along the horizonal, $s_x=x$, this function gives us the maximal height, $s_{max,y}(x)$, that \textit{any} firework could reach above $x$. \\
		We could work out which firework it was that reached that height by solving $z_{max}(x)=\tan(\theta)$ for $\theta$. \\
		Every trajectory is a parabola, and what we've found is that their maximal boundary is also parabolic. \\
		(The substitution $z=\tan(\theta)$ is valid as $\tan(\theta)$ is monotically increasing between $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$. This means that any turning points will be the same before and after the substitution.)
