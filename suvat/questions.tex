\multiproblem{huh5}{  This question deals with deriving the SUVAT equations. In general the differential equations relating displacement, velocity and acceleration of a body are given by $\frac{ds(t)}{dt}=v(t)$, and $\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=a(t)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using these, and the fact that we are modeling a situation where the acceleration is constant, derive an expression for $v(t)$ and one for $s(t)$ by integration. (Your solutions will look slightly different to S(1) and S(2), briefly explain this difference).

\item Using your answers from (a), derive S(5).

\item Using separation of variables, show that the area under a velocity-time plot (the graph of $v(t)$) is equal to the displacement. Is this result valid even for non-constant acceleration?

\item Constant acceleration implies constant gradient on a velocity-time plot, use this and a sketch to verify S(3).

\item From Newton's First Law, constant acceleration implies constant force acting on the body. Write down expressions for work done and kinetic energy, and hence derive S(4). (You will need to use the fact that work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy)

\begin{enumerate}
\item In an experiment I drive a car, mass $m$, from stationary to a flag 20m away applying constant acceleration of 4\mpssq. Find the time $t^*$ it takes me to reach the flag.

\item I repeat the experiment, but this time I see a hazard in the distance at time $\tau<t^*$ and immediately apply constant deceleration. Find an expression for $F$, the force required to bring the car to a stop at the flag, as a function of $\tau$. Sketch the graph of $F(\tau)$.

\item In another experiment, I drop a coin down a well which has a depth of 75\metres. Assuming the speed of sound is 300\mps, find the time at which I hear the coin hit the bottom.

\multiproblem{huh7}{  This question concerns a popular firework device which can fire fireworks out at any angle to the horizontal. We treat these fireworks as projectiles with initial speed $u$ under acceleration due to gravity $g$. We want to find an analytic expression for the boundary of the `safe area', where no firework can reach.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write down $\mathbf{u}=(u_x,u_y)$, the firework's initial velocity as an expression in $\theta$, the angle at which the firework is fired from.
\item If $\big(s_x(t), s_y(t)\big)$ is a firework's position at time $t$, show that the graph of a firework's trajectory is
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:s_y}
	s_y = s_x \tan\theta - \frac{s_x^2g}{2v^2}\big(1+\tan^2\theta\big).
\end{equation}

\textit{Hint: Begin by finding $s_x$ and $s_y$ and then relate them by explicitly eliminating $t$.}

\item Equation \ref{eq:s_y} is the family of all possible firework trajectories. You can think of it as $s_y$ as a function of $s_x$, parametrised by a choice of $\theta\in[0,\pi]$. In other words for a particular choice of $\theta$, the graph of $s_y(s_x)$ is that firework's trajectory. Now, we want to maximise this set over $\theta$. Find $\frac{\partial s_y}{\partial \theta}$ and hence find the maximal $s_y$ position for any given $s_x$ position.

\textit{Hint: Instead, use the substitution $z=\tan\theta$ and maximise $s_y(s_x)$ with respect to $z$. Bonus question: think why this substitution is allowed by considering the graph of $\tan(\theta)$.}

\item  Sketch the safe area boundary that you have found.

\end{enumerate}}
