\multiproblem{groups1}{Which of the following sets with binary operations are groups? Justify your answer. Here $+$ represents addition and $*$ denotes multiplication. (Note that you don't need to worry about the associativity because we have assumed this - see the preamble).
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $(\left\{ -1, 0, 1 \right\},+)$.
   \item $(\left\{-1, 0, 1 \right\},*)$.
  \item $(\left\{ -1, 1 \right\},*)$.

\multiproblem{groupsa}{Now we shall consider some groups of symmetries.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the equilateral triangle shown below.\\
        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{triangle.pdf}
        \end{center}
  It has the following three rotational symmetries:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $e$, the rotation of $0^{\circ}$ (doing nothing)
  \item $x$, the rotation of $120^{\circ}$ anticlockwise
  \item $y$, the rotation of $120^{\circ}$ clockwise.
  \end{enumerate}
  Now let $T=\left\{ e,x,y \right\}$ and $\bullet$ be the binary operation on $T$ such that $x\bullet y$ denotes transformation $y$ followed by transformation $x$. Find the table of $\bullet$ acting on the set $T$. Show that $(T,\bullet)$ a group. You can assume that $\bullet$ is associative. What is the identity element? What is the inverse of each element?
        \item
        Consider the square shown below.
                \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{square.pdf}
        \end{center}
        It has the following four rotational symmetries:
          \begin{enumerate}
  \item $e$, the rotation of $0^{\circ}$ (doing nothing)
  \item $x$, the rotation of $90^{\circ}$ anticlockwise
  \item $y$, the rotation of $180^{\circ}$
  \item $z$, the rotation of $90^{\circ}$ clockwise.
    \end{enumerate}
    Now let $S=\left\{ e,x,y,z \right\}$ and $\bullet$ be the associative binary operation as defined as in $(i)$. Find the table of $\bullet$ acting on the set $S$. Show that $(S,\bullet)$ a group. What is the identity element? What is the inverse of each element? There is one subgroup of order 2. Can you spot it?
    
        \item Consider the rectangle shown below.
                        \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{rectangle.pdf}
        \end{center}
        It has the following flipping over symmetries:
        \begin{enumerate}
  \item $e$, not flipping (doing nothing)
  \item $h$, flipping horizontally
  \item $v$, flipping vertically
  \item $hv$, flipping vertically and then horizontally (note this is the same as $h\bullet v$).
  \end{enumerate}
        Now let $R=\left\{ e,h,v,hv \right\}$ and $\bullet$ be the associative binary operation as defined as in $(i)$. Find the table of $\bullet$ acting on the set $R$. Show that $(R,\bullet)$ a group. What is the identity element? What is the inverse of each element? There are three subgroups of order 2. Can you spot them?
        \end {enumerate}

\multiproblem{groupsb}{
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Show that $(\left\{0,1,2\right\},+\: \text{mod}\:3)$ is a group by finding the table of $+\: \text{mod} \:3$ over $\left\{0,1,2\right\}$. (Don't worry about associativity - you may assume modular addition is associative.) What is the identity element? What is the inverse of each element?
 \item Two finite groups are {\em isomorphic} if they have the same binary operation tables up to a relabelling of the elements. Compare the table you have just found in $(a)$ with that of the rotations of the triangle $(T,\bullet)$ in 2 (a). Are $(\left\{0,1,2\right\},+\: \text{mod}\: 3)$ and $(T,\bullet)$ isomorphic?
 \item Show that all groups of order 3 are isomorphic to one another. (Hint: Take a general set $e,x,y$ and binary operation. Consider what possible multiplication tables are possible whilst still keeping the group properties of closure, identity and inverse. It's a bit like completing a Sudoku.)
 \end{enumerate}
}

\multiproblem{groupsc}{
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Show that $(\left\{0,1,2,3\right\},+\: \text{mod}\: 4)$ is a group by finding the table of $+\: \text{mod}\: 4$ over $\left\{0,1,2,3\right\}$. What is the identity element? What is the inverse of each element? Which group in 2. is this group isomorphic to? 
 \item Show that $(\left\{1,3,5,7\right\},*\: \text{mod}\: 8)$ is a group by finding the table of $*\: \text{mod}\: 8$ over $\left\{1,3,5,7\right\}$. What is the identity element? What is the inverse of each element? (Don't worry about associativity - you may assume modular multiplication is associative.)  Which group in 2. is this group isomorphic to? 
 \item The group in (i) above is known as the cyclic group of order 4 (denoted $C_{4}$) and the group in (ii) is known as the Klein four-group (denoted $V_{4}$). Show that all groups of order 4 are isomorphic to one of these. (Hint: proceed in a similar way to 3 (iii).)

\multiproblem{groups2}{Now let us prove some properties that hold true for any group $(G,\bullet)$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Prove that $(x\bullet y)^{-1}=y^{-1}x^{-1}$  $\forall \: x,y\in G$.
 \item Prove that the identity element $e\in G$ is unique. 
 \item Prove that the inverse of any element $x^{-1}$ in $G$ is unique.

 Now suppose that $(G,\bullet)$ is an abelian group.
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Prove that $(x\bullet y)^{2}=x^{2}\bullet y^{2}~~ \forall \: x,y \in G.$
