In this worksheet we consider planar statics problems, and how to solve the linear systems of equations that arise when solving them.

From Newton's laws of motion, for the static equilibrium of a body both translational forces and moments must balance. Specifically, the vector sum of the external forces must equal zero:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:trans}
 \sum_{i} {\bf F}_{i}= \bf{0}
\end{equation}
This is called the {\em external force balance}. 

If one body is {\em resting} on another, the reaction force $N$ must be positive.

If friction acts a point of contact, the friction condition $F\leq \mu N$ must always be satisfied.

The force in a spring of stiffness $sk$ with extension $x$ from its natural length $L$ is given by Hooke's law, $F=kx$.
