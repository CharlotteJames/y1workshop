What is the new value for the coefficient of friction in this case? %\A As forces are balence in this equilibrium $F_H_{max}=F_f_{max}= \mu m g$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Figure  \ref{blahdiblah} shows a configuration of a mass which we will treat as a point particle hanging on a light spring. The particle has mass $m$, and the distance of the particle from the ceiling is $x$m. th spring has the following propeties: spring constant $k$N/m and natural length $l$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item{ Firstly, justify that the units of the spring constan are N/m with the use of Hooke's Law. %\A Force (N) = constant $\times$ extension (m), and so constant= Force (N) / extension (m)
	}
	\item{Find the distance $x$ given that $m=10$kg, $k=109$N/m and $l=$1m. %\A Restorative spring force $F_s=k(x-l)$, weight $F_G=mg$, forces balenced and so $F_s=F_G=k(x-l)=mg$, and so $x=\frac{mg}{k}+l=0.9+1=1.9$m
	}
	\item{Now instead, find a general expression for the distance $x$ in terms of the parameters $m,l,g,k$. %\A see above

\begin{enumerate}
item Figure \ref{Blahdiblah} shows a configuration of a block of mass $m$kg on a surface. The block is also attached by a spring (with spring constant $k$N/m and natural length $l$) to the wall and the distance from this wall is given by $x$.Given that $m=1$ kg and $l=1$m:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{ What is the value of the normal reaction force on the block? %\A  Normal force and weight are balanced $F_n=mg=9.81$N
	}
	\item{Assuming that the surface is smooth ($\mu=1$) and the spring constant $k>0$, state the distance $x$ at which the system is in equilbrium. %\A The horizontal forces must balance so the spring force $F_s=k(x-l)$ is equivalent to the frictional force $F_f\leq\mu F_N$, since $\mu=0$ this frictional force must also equal 0 and so $F_s=k(x-l)=0$ which implies $x=l$m

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Figure \ref{fuckingfuck} shows a cofiguration of masses and pulleys. Both the block and the particle have mass $m=1$kg}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Draw free body force diagrams for both the block and the particle}
	\item{Point b is at position $(-1$i$,1$j$)$ from point O. If $m=1$kg and $\mu=1$ can the system be in equilibrium? %\A Yes: If in equilbrium the forces are balancd on the particle and so the tension in the pulley string is equivalent to the weight of the particle ($T_p=mg$). Now looking at the block we can see that the frictional force must act on the block in the direction down the slope. So assuming equilbrium, resolving the forces parallel to the slope we have $T_p=mg=mg$sin$(\theta) + F_f$ where $theta$ is the angle of the slope. This angle of the slope with the horizontal can be found to be $theta=45^o=\pi/4$rad from the position vector. Furthermore, the frictional force is given by the inequality $F_f\leq \mu F_N$ where $F_N$ is the normal force (perpendicaular to the slope). This can be found to give $F_f\leq \mu  mg$cos$(\theta)$. If we substitute this into the earlier equation we find $mg(1-$sin$(\theta))=F_f\leq\mu  mg$cos$(\theta)$ which simplifies to $1-$sin$(\theta)\leq$cos$(\theta)$ which is easily shown to be true. 
	}
	\item{What is the critical value of $\mu$ (the smallest value such that the system may still be in equilbirum)? %\A At this critical point $F_f=\mu F_n$ and so it can be found in the same way as before that $\mu mg$cos$(\theta)+mg$sin$(\theta)=mg$ which can be easily rearranged to give $\mu=(1-$sin$(\theta))/$cos$(\theta))=\sqrt{2}-1\approx 0.41	$

            \begin{enumerate}
            	\item Draw a free-body diagram of the system
		\item If mass $m = 10$ is located at point $(x,y) = (-2,1)$ and the slope makes contact with the horizontal ($x$-axis) at point $(0,0)$, determine the maximum value of the 			friction force, $F$, which ensures the system is in equilibrium. {\it Assume $\mu =1$}.
			%\A First find $\alpha$
		\item In the absence of friction, what would be the acceleration of the mass? 
		%\A Acceleration acts down the slope and is therefore the net force parallel to the slope divided by the mass: $F = ma \to a = \frac{F}{m}$: $a = g\sin(\alpha)$
		\item Derive an inequality in terms of parameter $\alpha$ that defines the range of values of $\mu$ for which this system will remain in equilibrium.
		%\A We need to use Coulomb Friction: $|F| \leq \mu N$.
		%\A From the free body diagram: $N= mg\cos(\alpha)$ ($1$), $F = mg\sin(\alpha)$ ($2$).
		%\A Using $2$ and Coulomb Friction, we have $|mg\sin(\alpha)| \leq N \mu$, therefore (using $1$ to eliminate $N$), $\mu \geq |\tan(\alpha)|$
             	\item Sketch the variation in the maximum value of $\mu$ as a function of angle $\alpha$ for the range $0 \leq \alpha \leq \pi/2$. Interpret your sketch for large $\alpha$ ($\alpha 			\to \pi/2$).

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Draw a free body diagram of the system.
		\item Derive an inequality in terms of parameters $m$, $g$, $\alpha$, $k$, $L$ and $\mu$,  that defines the range of values of $x$, the length of the spring, for 					which this system is in equilibrium.
		%\A We need to use Coulomb Friction: $|F| \leq \mu N$, where $F$ is the net force acting parallel to the slope.
		%\A From the free body diagram: $N= mg\cos(\alpha)$ ($1$), $F = mg\sin(\alpha) - k(x-L)$ ($2$).
		%\A Using $2$ and Coulomb Friction, we have $|mg\sin(\alpha) - k(x-L)| \leq mg\cos(\alpha) \mu$
		%\A Rearranging: |x| \leq \frac{mg}{k}(\cos(\alpha) \mu - \sin(\alpha)) -L
		\item If the spring is replaced by one which is stiffer, how does this affect the range of extensions for which the mass is stationary? Use a sketch to demonstrate this result.

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Draw a free body diagram for each mass.
	\item Find an expression for the range of values of $\mu$, the coefficient of friction, that ensure the system is in equilibrium. To simplify your expressions, use $\epsilon_i = x_i - L_i$ where $\epsilon_i$ corresponds to the extension of spring $i$.
	%\A From the free body diagrams we have: $N_1 = m_1g$, $N_2 = m_2g$, $F_2 = k_2(x_2-L_2) = k_2\epsilon_2$, $F_1 = k_1(x_1-L_1-x_2 + L_2) = k_2(\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2)$
	%\A Applying Coulomb Friction to each mass we obtain: $|\frac{k_1}{m_1g}(\epsilon_1 - \epsilon_2) |\leq \mu$ and $|\frac{k_2}{m_2g}\epsilon_2| \leq \mu$

	\item If $m_2 = \beta m_1$, $\epsilon_2 = \gamma \epsilon_1$ and $k_2 = \delta k_1$, using the expression from part ii, sketch a graph for $\mu$ as a function of $\beta$. Sketch another graph for $\mu$ as a function of $\delta$. How does this differ from a system of only one mass (question 1.b)?
	%\A Using the expression derived above and substituting for $m_2$, $k_2$ and $\epsilon_2$, we obtain:
