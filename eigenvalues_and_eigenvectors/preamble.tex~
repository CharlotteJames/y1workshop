In previous worksheets we have discussed how to linear systems of equations of the form
\begin{equation}\label{lin}
  {\bf A} { \bf x}= {\bf b}
\end{equation}
through the method of Gaussian elimination. First, the augmented matrix $[  {\bf A}|{ \bf b} ]$ can be constructed, and then row operations can be used to put the matrix into upper triangular (or echelon) form. It is then possible to solve each component of ${\bf x}$ using back substitution starting from the bottom row.

This system has a unique solution if and only if $\text{det}( {\bf A})$ is non-zero. If $\text{det}( {\bf A})=0$, then there are either no solutions or infinitely many. In particular, if $\text{Rank}( {\bf A}) < \text{Rank}( [{\bf A}|{\bf b}])$ there is no solution. If $\text{Rank}( {\bf A}) = \text{Rank}([ {\bf A}|{\bf b}])$ there is an infinite family of solutions.

The system \eqref{lin} is called {\em homogeneous} in the case where ${\bf b}={\bf 0}$.

{\em Eigenvectors} are special non-zero vectors, ${\bf v}$, whose direction does not change under matrix multiplication. That is
\[ 
 {\bf A} {\bf v} = \lambda {\bf v}
\]
for scalar $\lambda$. This $\lambda$ is the corresponding stretch factor, called the {\em eigenvalue}.
