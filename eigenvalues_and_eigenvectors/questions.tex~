For the following homogeneous linear systems, use Gaussian elimination (constructing the augmented matrix and performing row operations) to obtain the set of solutions. What is the cardinality (size) of this set?

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & -1 & 2 \\
 2 & 1 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  x \\ y \\ z
 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}

Show that the vectors
\begin{equation*}
 {\bf x_1}=
 \begin{pmatrix}
  -3 \\ 3 \\ 3
 \end{pmatrix}
\hspace{10pt}\text{and}\hspace{10pt}
 {\bf x_2} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  2 \\ -2 \\ -2
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
are solutions of this system. By explicit calculation, verify whether ${\bf x_1}+{\bf x_2}$ is also solution.

\item 
\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & 7 & -4 \\
 2 & 4 & -1 \\
 3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  x \\ y \\ z
 \end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 \\ 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}

Show that the vectors
\begin{equation*}
 {\bf x_1}=
 \begin{pmatrix}
  -9 \\ 7 \\ 10
 \end{pmatrix}
\hspace{10pt}\text{and}\hspace{10pt}
 {\bf x_2} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  -3 \\ \frac{7}{3} \\ \frac{10}{3}
 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
are solutions of this system. By explicit calculation, verify whether ${\bf x_1}+{\bf x_2}$ is also solution.

 \item \begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
 -1 & 1 & -1 \\
 3 & -1 & -1 \\
 2 & 1 & -3
\end{pmatrix}

Consider the matrix equation
\begin{equation} \label{homo}
 {\bf {\bf A}x}= {\bf 0}
\end{equation}
where ${\bf A}$ is a known $n\times n$ matrix, ${\bf 0}$ is the $n \times 1$ zero vector and ${\bf x}$ is a $n \times 1$ vector of unknowns to be found. This is an example of a homogeneous linear system of equations.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Prove that ${\bf x}={ \bf 0}$ is always a solution to \eqref{homo}. This solution is known as the {\em trivial} solution. Any non-zero solutions to \eqref{homo}, if they exist, are called {\em non-trivial} solutions. 
 \item Prove that if ${\bf x}$ is a solution to \eqref{homo} then $ \alpha {\bf x}$ is also a solution, for any scalar $\alpha$.
 \item Assume that ${\bf x}_1$ and ${\bf x}_2$ are both solutions to \eqref{homo}. Prove that ${\bf x}_{1} + {\bf x}_{2}$ is also a solution to \eqref{homo}.
 \item Given vectors ${\bf v}_{1}$ and ${\bf v}_{2}$ and scalars $\alpha$ and $\beta$, $\alpha {\bf v}_{1}+\beta {\bf v}_{2}$ is called a {\em linear combination} of ${\bf v}_{1}$ and ${\bf v}_{2}$. Using your results from $(b)$ and $(c)$, prove that any linear combination of ${\bf x}_1$ and ${\bf x}_2$ is a solution of \eqref{homo}.
 \item Assume that \eqref{homo} has a non-trivial solution ${\bf x}$. Is this solution unique? Hence, what can we say about $\text{det}({\bf A})$.
 
Consider the homogeneous linear system ${\bf A}{\bf x}= {\bf 0}$:
\begin{equation} \label{homo2d}
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a & b \\ c & d
 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
 x \\ y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
 0 \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
 \item  What is the condition (in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$) for there to be a non-trivial solution to this homogeneous linear system? What is the determinant of ${\bf A}$ in this case?
 \item Suppose that $a=4$, $b=-2$, $c=3$ and $d=3$. Consider the two equations as two lines in the $x$-$y$ plane. What are the equations of these lines? Sketch them. The intersection of the lines corresponds to the solution of \eqref{homo2d}. What is the set of solutions? Without explicitly calculating it, explain whether $\text{det}({\bf A})$ is non-zero. Explicitly calculate the determinant and verify your conclusion.
  \item Now suppose that $a=-6$, $b=2$, $c=3$ and $d=-1$. Proceed as above in $(g)$.
 \item If the solution to \eqref{homo2d} is non-trivial what can we say about the gradient of the two lines?
\end{enumerate}

{\em Eigenvectors} are special non-zero vectors, ${\bf v}$, whose direction does not change under matrix multiplication. That is
\[ 
 {\bf A} {\bf v} = \lambda {\bf v}
\]
for scalar $\lambda$. This $\lambda$ is the corresponding stretch factor, called the {\em eigenvalue}.}
