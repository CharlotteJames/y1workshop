This worksheet introduces the idea of {\em linear operators}. An {\em operator} takes as input a function and returns another function as output. We call $L$ a linear operator if and only if it has both of the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Homogeneity: $L(\alpha\mathbf{x})=\alpha L\mathbf{x}$
\item Additivity: $L(\mathbf{x_{1}}+{\mathbf{x}_{2}})=L\mathbf{x_{1}}+L\mathbf{x_{2}}$
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Example}\\
Q. {\em The differential operator takes any function as input and returns its derivative as output. Prove that the differentiation operator is linear.} \\
A. Let $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ be functions with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ constants. Consider: $\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}(\alpha \mathbf{x}_{1}+\beta \mathbf{x}_{2})$. \\
Apply the sum rule in differentiation: $\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}(\alpha \mathbf{x}_{1})+\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}(\beta \mathbf{x}_{2})$. Apply the constant factor rule in differentiation: $\alpha \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}(\mathbf{x}_{1})+\beta \frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}(\mathbf{x}_{2})$.\\
