  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Given homogeneity and additivity, prove that the principal of superposition is satisfied: $L(\alpha\mathbf{x_{1}}+\beta\mathbf{x_{2}})=\alpha L\mathbf{x_{1}}+\beta L\mathbf{x_{2}}$\\
You can prove bidirectional as linearity is equivalent to superposition.
\item Prove if an operator is linear or not:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\int_{}^{}dx$ (integration)

Consider $n$th-Order Linear Non-homogeneous Differential Equation:\\
\begin{align} 
{{y^{\left( n \right)}}\left( x \right) + {a_1}\left( x \right){y^{\left( {n - 1} \right)}}\left( x \right) +  \cdots  }
+ {{a_{n - 1}}\left( x \right)y'\left( x \right) + {a_n}\left( x \right)y\left( x \right)}=f(x)
\end{align}

The associated $n$th-Order Linear Homogeneous Differential Equation:
\begin{align} 
{{y^{\left( n \right)}}\left( x \right) + {a_1}\left( x \right){y^{\left( {n - 1} \right)}}\left( x \right) +  \cdots  }
+ {{a_{n - 1}}\left( x \right)y'\left( x \right) + {a_n}\left( x \right)y\left( x \right)}=0
\end{align}

Using the operator $Ly = f(x)$ we can re-write:\\

\begin{align} 
Ly={{y^{\left( n \right)}}\left( x \right) + {a_1}\left( x \right){y^{\left( {n - 1} \right)}}\left( x \right) +  \cdots  }
+ {{a_{n - 1}}\left( x \right)y'\left( x \right) + {a_n}\left( x \right)y\left( x \right)}
\end{align}

where $L$ is the $n$th-order linear operator.The coefficients $a_{1}(x)$ and  $a_{n}(x)$ can be either constants or functions $f(x)$. \\
Homogeneous Linear Differential Equations can be written in the form: $Ly=0$.\\
Non-homogeneous Linear Differential Equations: $Ly=f(x)$.\\

\begin{enumerate}
 \item  Show that for Second-Order Linear Differential Equation if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants, then $L$ satisfies $L(\alpha y_{1}+\beta y_{2})=\alpha Ly_{1}+\beta Ly_{2}$\\\\
Proof (start):\\
Apply the operator $L$: $L(\alpha y_{1}+\beta y_{2})=a_{1}(x)\frac{{d}^2(\alpha y_{1}+\beta y_{2})}{{d}x^2}+...$\\
Regroup:..........\\
Get the final result: $\alpha Ly_{1}+\beta Ly_{2}$ 
 \item Show that if $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are two solutions of a homogeneous linear differential equation Ly = 0, then every linear combination $y=\alpha y_{1} + \beta y_{2}$ with arbitrarily chosen coefficients is also a solution of $Ly = 0$.\\\\
Proof (start):\\
Suppose that $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are two solutions of the differential equation. This means that $Ly_{1}=0.$\\
.............
\item The following Second-Order Differential Equation is given:
$\frac{\mathrm{d^2y} }{\mathrm{d} x^2} - y=0$\\
1. Show that $y_{1}=e^x$ and $y_{2}=e^{-x}$ are fundamental solutions for the above equation.
2. Using the superposition principle, come up with (a) any particular solution and (b) a general solution.

\item Linear differential equations can be represented in the form $Ly=f(x)$ where L is a linear operator.
Determine if a differential equation is linear or not:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $ \frac{\mathrm{d^2y} }{\mathrm{d} x^2} +y^2 =0$
\item $ \frac{\mathrm{d^4y} }{\mathrm{d} x^4} -y=1$
\item $ \frac{\mathrm{d^2y} }{\mathrm{d} x^2} -y \frac{\mathrm{dy} }{\mathrm{d} x} =0$
\end{enumerate}

\multiproblem{nonhom}{

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are two solutions of a linear second order non-homogeneous differential equation $L(y) = f(x)$. \\
1. Show that their difference (not sum!!!) $y=y_{1}-y_{2}$ is the solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation $L(y) = 0$. \\
2. Show that all solutions for Second-Order Non-homogeneous Linear Differential Equations can be written as the sum of the complementary function (general solution of the associated homogeneous equation) and a particular solution of a non-homogeneous equation.\\

\item Using results in 2.3 and 2.5, come up with a general solution for the non-homogeneous differential equation:
$\frac{\mathrm{d^2y} }{\mathrm{d} x^2} - y=x$\\

\item Use the linearity to solve the following differential equation:
$\frac{\mathrm{d^2y} }{\mathrm{d} x^2} - y= 4e^{2x}+e^{-3x}$.\\

We can use linearity to split the problem into the solution of the two equations:\\
$\frac{\mathrm{d^2y} }{\mathrm{d} x^2} - y= e^{2x}$.\\
$\frac{\mathrm{d^2y} }{\mathrm{d} x^2} - y= e^{-3x}$.\\

Notice that the complementary function still needs to be worked out from the homogeneous equation.
The general solution will be in the form: \\
$y=y_{c}+4y_{1}+5y_{2}$

Consider a pendulum with a rod of negligible mass attaching a weight of mass $m$ to the pivot, and with all mass
concentrated at the weightâ€™s center of gravity at distance $l$ from the pivot. The motion, that is a repeated switching back and forth from side to side, is called an oscillation.
